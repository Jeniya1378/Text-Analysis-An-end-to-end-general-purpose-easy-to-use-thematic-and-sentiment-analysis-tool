Given the sheer volume and complexity of textual data that is available as well as collected on a daily basis in todayâ€™s world, it has become an incredibly difficult task to extract useful information and uncover meaningful data from them. Apart from limited ability to process large amount of texts manually by humans, we also introduce our own biases in the analysis process which clouds our judgement and produces skewed results. With recent major advancements in Machine Learning (ML) and Natural Language Processing (NLP), many techniques have been established to perform sentiment and thematic analysis from texts that can perform analysis on large amount of textual data identifying key components for deriving actionable insights. However, these techniques are intricate to understand and implement, often case-specific, and require advanced expert knowledge, which makes it impossible for general users to get benefit from them. In this project, we present a text analysis tool that is easy to use and performs effective thematic and sentiment analysis on a wide variety of texts without requiring to code and knowledge of NLP/ML as it offers higher level of abstraction and versatility.
